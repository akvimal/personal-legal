Ask the user for the component name and type (ui/layout/feature), then create a new component file following the project's component structure:

1. Create the component file in the appropriate directory (src/components/ui, src/components/layout, or src/components/features)
2. Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
3. Include React.forwardRef if appropriate
4. Use the cn() utility for className management
5. Follow the project's coding standards
6. Add proper JSDoc comments

Provide an example usage after creating the component.
