description: Create a new page in the Next.js app router
---

Ask the user for the page route name, then create a new page following Next.js 16 App Router conventions:

1. Create the directory structure in src/app/
2. Create page.tsx with 'use client' directive
3. Set up basic page structure with proper TypeScript types
4. Include basic layout with the appropriate components
5. Add the route to the sidebar navigation if needed

Explain the file structure and how to access the new page.
